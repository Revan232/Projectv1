                <h3>My Story</h3>
                <p>Hello! I'm a passionate photographer who specializes in capturing the beauty of everyday life. My journey with photography started 5 years ago when I first picked up a camera during a trip abroad.</p>
                <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">What began as a casual hobby quickly evolved into a lifelong passion. I'm constantly exploring new techniques and styles to expand my creative horizons. My work has been featured in several local exhibitions and online photography communities.</p>
                <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">When I'm not behind the camera, you'll find me hiking in nature, exploring urban landscapes, or enjoying a good book at my favorite caf√©.</p>

                <h3>Photography Style</h3>
                <p>I specialize in landscape and portrait photography, with a focus on natural lighting and authentic moments. I believe that the most powerful images are those that tell a story and evoke emotion.</p>
